    #Aviation Accident Risk Analysis
    
    ## Overview
   The project focuses on anaylzing aviation accident data hence it helps a company to decide which aircraft is more cheaper and has a lower risk of fatal accident.The firm is venturing into aviation industry and therefore it requires insights of aviation data in order to make inform decision on which aircraft is best to invest at. 
 
    ## Business Understanding
   The stakeholder interested in this project is the Head of the Aviation Dision.
    
    **Business problem:**
   The company wants to invest in aircraft but they dont know anything about the possible risks of aircraft. Inaccurate aircraft selection might cause very high maintance, insurance cost and can also lead to more numbers of aircraft death.
    
    **Key Business Question:**
   1.What has changed over time in aircraft safety?
   2.Which Aircraft has the lowest number of fatal accidents?
   3.Which aircraft makers have the lowest accident rate?
    
    ## Data Understanding and Analysis
    
    ### Data Source 
   -Aviation accident data from 1962-2023
   -National Transportation Safety Board
    
    ### Data preparation
  -Filtered for Airplane related Accidents Only
  -Limited analysis to accidents occuring in the United States
  -Remove rows with missing aircraft model or make data
  -Developed indicator for fatal accidents
    
    ##Visualization of the data
    
    ## 1. Accidents by Aircraft Manufacturer
The bar chart depicts the number of accidents attributed to leading aircraft manufacturers.  
Some manufacturers tend to have fewer accidents, indicating lower aircraft  risk.


    ## 2. Fatal Accident by Aircraft Manufacturer
The visualization shows a comparison of  aircraft models based on the percentage of accidents in each model.  
Some model of aircraft have a greatly reduced rate of fatal accident rates making them safer investment options for starting.


    ### 3. Aircraft Accidents Over Time
A line chart representing the total number of accidents each year.Air safety has improved over time.

    ##Conclusion
    
 1. Model with low rates of fatal aircraft accidents should be the priority to address the issues regarding flight safety and liability risks.
 2. Buy aircraft from suppliers with consistently low accident records to reduce long-term operational costs.
 3. Invest in more modern designs with improved safety record over time.
